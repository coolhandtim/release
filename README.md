release

When updating DLC manually: please wait a few seconds (5 at most) to be sure that the DLC list has fully downloaded before navigating away from the page. I found out the hard way that there's no way to ensure that the DLC list fully updates if users navigate away from the page.
Automatic updates should work just fine as long as users stay on the page they're on for a good amount of time (again, a few seconds, depending on how slow your connection/Github is).

Should this repeatedly fail, I recommend nuking all of SGP's saved data (on the Advanced tab in the settings page).

THIS ADD ON IS DEPRECATED WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF SG V2.
